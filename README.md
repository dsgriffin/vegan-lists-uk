# Vegan Lists UK 

A simple Ionic-based iOS app for viewing/saving official/unofficial vegan food lists (UK based).

# Features/Details
* View both official and unofficial lists of Vegan food products (provided by the store themselves or volunteers respectively).
* Online links may lead to newer lists than the ones available offline.
* Offline lists are in the form of PDF's and vary in description/size.


# Requirements

As Offline lists are PDF files, you'll need a local application that can view them. iPhones come with [iBooks](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201478) by default; [Adobe Acrobat](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/adobe-acrobat-reader/id469337564?mt=8) is a good alternative.

# Device Support

iPhone only (5c and above), requires iOS 8 or above.

# Build

**Requirements:** `Xcode`, `Node v4.0+`, `npm v2.0+`
   
If you have the above, then:

* Download/Clone repo
* `npm install`
* `ionic build ios` to build for the platform
* `ionic prepare ios` to prepare it for iOS testing/running
* open up `Xcode` and test via device/simulator
