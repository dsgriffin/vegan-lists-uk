# Vegan Lists UK

Simple Ionic 2 iOS app for viewing/collecting official/unofficial Vegan food lists (UK-based).

# Why?

I created this app partly because I always seem to lose internet connection in places like supermarkets when I want to find what Vegan food they sell (and somehow I keep managing to forget to research it before I go out).

The second part is because I'd like to learn Angular 2/Ionic 2 and there's no better way than to learn by doing :)

# Features/Details
* View both official and unofficial lists of Vegan food products (provided by the store themselves or volunteers respectively).
* Online links may lead to newer lists than the ones available offline.
* Offline lists are in the form of PDF's and vary in description/size.

# Support

iPhone only (5c and above), requires iOS 8 or above.

# Build

**Requirements:** `xcode`, `Node v4.0+`, `npm v2.0+`
   
If you have the above, then:

* Download/Clone repo
* `npm install`
* `ionic build ios` to build for the platform
* `ionic prepare ios` to prepare it for iOS testing/running
* open up `xcode` and test via device/emulator
